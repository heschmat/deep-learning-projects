# Projects for Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree 

## 1. Dog Breed Classifier
In this project, I will define a Convolutional Neural Network that performs better than the average human when given the task: identifying dog breeds. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will produce an estimate of the dog's breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will *also* produce an estimate of the closest-resembling dog breed.

## 2. Generate TV Scripts
In this project, I will build my own Recurrent Networks and Long Short-Term Memory Networks with PyTorch. I'll perform sentiment analysis and generate new text, and use recurrent networks to generate new text that resembles a training set of TV scripts.

## 3. Generate Faces
In this project, I'll apply what I've learned about Generative Adversarial Networks and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN. This DCGAN is made of a pair of multi-layer neural networks that compete against each other until one learns to generate realistic images of faces.

## 4. Pneumonia Detection From Chest X-Rays
In this project, I will analyze __the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset__ and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. This project will culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. Furthermore, I will formally describe my model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria.
