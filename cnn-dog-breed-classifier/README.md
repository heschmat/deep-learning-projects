# Dog Breed Classifier

## Project Overview
In this project I've used CNN to create an algorithm - both from scratch, as well as using transfer learning- to detect various dog breeds. Furthermore, the project can be used as a first step for a fun app in which it first tries to see if the input image is a dog or a human, if it's a dog then its breed is returned; if it's a human, it says hi and provides the most similar dog breed for that particular photo. In case neither a dog, nor a human is detected, a warning will be printed out.

## File Overview
`dog-app.ipnb` the main file that includes the analysis of the project with heavy documents and explanations. 
`dog-app.html` an html copy of the notebook.
